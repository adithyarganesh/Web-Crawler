# Web-Crawler
Collected data through web crawling by performing different functions

Used the Beautiful Soup library to crawl through various web pages and gather required data.

#Selenium
For automation I used selenium, one of its uses is for web pages with infinite scrolling. An example usage of that 
can be found at https://github.com/adithyarganesh/Fantasy-Football-Analysis

#Applications
In the following repository, I performed the following functions
  1. Make a simple custom search. 
    Uses: 
    Enter the item you would like to search for and a list of corresponding links will be provided as the output
    A single search in your web browser gives upto 10 websites.
    A web crawler can be made to provide infinite number of links
  
  2. Youtube Trending feed
    Uses:
    Helps form a data-set of the currently trending videos on youtube
    Analyse the number of views and other functions
    
  3. Movies and TV-Series link-finder
    This provides a list of currently released movies that can be downloaded.
    Provides the quality of the video whch helps find if there is a quality upgrade
    
    
This repository helps a newbie get a hang of using web crawlers and how to implement them
